## Students' Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning (SVM and Logistic Regression)

In an age where accurate predictions of students' academic performance are of paramount importance, machine learning offers an unprecedented opportunity. Accurate predictions enable early identification of struggling students, allowing for timely interventions and improved academic outcomes. With the vast amount of data available, machine learning empowers us to create accurate predictive models that enhance educational practices.

This project is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model that predicts students' academic performance using logistic regression and support vector machine models. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 81%, while the support vector machine model reached an impressive accuracy of 84%. We meticulously pre-processed and cleaned the dataset, ensuring that only meaningful and relevant features were considered. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize model performance, and ethical considerations were integrated to ensure fairness and transparency in the models. This project showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting student performance while emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in such endeavours.

## About the Project

Our mission is to predict students' academic performance with precision using logistic regression and support vector machine models. The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing and cleaning to ensure that only meaningful features were utilized. We also tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance while maintaining ethical considerations to ensure fairness and transparency. Predicting student academic performance has profound implications for the educational landscape.

By identifying at-risk students early, educators can provide targeted support and resources to improve academic success. Additionally, institutions can allocate resources more efficiently, such as identifying high-achieving students suitable for advanced programs. Predictive models can also enhance retention rates and overall student success, addressing the growing pressures in the education sector.

The front end of the application is developed using Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly and interactive experience for users.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop machine learning models using logistic regression and support vector machines to predict students' academic performance. These models empower educators and institutions to understand student needs better, enhance academic outcomes, and allocate resources efficiently. Stakeholders include students, institutions, educators, and families.

## Proposed System

We present an automated solution for the holistic evaluation of college students' performance using machine learning. Our system relies on a well-defined set of rules and a descriptive dataset featuring attributes such as school, sex, age, address, family size, parent status, parental education, parental jobs, reason for schooling, guardian, travel time, study time, failures, school support, family support, paid activities, higher education aspirations, internet access, free time, social outings, health, and absences.
